# Website-Portfolio-v2

This is a new revision of my portfolio website. It features a navbar which links to sections on the main index page, social icons with links, project section with links to github projects, and a contact section leading to a form page.

The form page allows users to send me emails if they are interested in business opportunities. obfuscates email address from the public internet using formsubmit.co service and provides some protection from bot attacks using captcha.
