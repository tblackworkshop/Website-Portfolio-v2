# Website-Portfolio-v2

This is a new revision of my portfolio website. It features a navbar which links to sections on the main index page, social icons with links, project section with links to github projects, and a contact section leading to a form page.

The form page allows user to send an email to me indicating a business opportunity. obfuscates email address from the public internet using formsubmit.co service and provides some protection from bot attacks using captcha.
