# Website-Portfolio-v2

www.tylerblack.dev

This is the second revision of my portfolio website. It features a navbar which links to sections on the main index page, social icons with links, project section with links to github projects, and a contact section leading to a form page.

The form page allows users to send me emails if they are interested in business opportunities. obfuscates email address from the public internet using formsubmit.co and provides some protection from bot attacks using captcha.

The website was deployed using AWS Amplify. I used AWS to secure the site by creating a SSL certificate, which is required to use the .dev domain name. The website requires https in order to connect. DNS records were set up using google domains.

Idea for the logo came from a Stable Diffusion AI generated image. I painted my own version in Krita used the hand made version as the triangle logo visible in the top left of the desktop version of the website. I ran this through favicon generator on favicon.io to generate a smaller version of the logo for use in the browser tab. Social media icons are sourced from fontawesome and custom fonts are from google fonts.

Site is reactive to display size and will dynamically adjust elements if viewed on mobile.
