# Website-Portfolio-v2

www.tylerblack.dev

This is a new revision of my portfolio website. It features a navbar which links to sections on the main index page, social icons with links, project section with links to github projects, and a contact section leading to a form page.

The form page allows users to send me emails if they are interested in business opportunities. obfuscates email address from the public internet using formsubmit.co and provides some protection from bot attacks using captcha.

The website was deployed using AWS Amplify. I used AWS to secure the site by creating a SSL certificate, which is required to use the .dev domain name. The website requires https in order to connect. DNS records were set up using google domains.
